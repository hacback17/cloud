# Cloud Computing

## Cloud computing has five characteristics:

1. On-demand and Self-service
   * No human intervention needed to get resources. Customers using the automated interface get processing power, storage and the network they need without the typical complex configuration.
2. Broad network access
   * Access from anywhere
3. Resource pooling
   * Providers share resources to consumers. Resources are available at multiple locations, you just need to decide where to get the resource from.
4. Rapid elasticity
   * Get more resources quickly as needed
5. Measured service
   * Pay only for what you use

Cloud computing is essentially the continuation of a model that rent out computing infrastructure and have it managed by dedicated professionals.
