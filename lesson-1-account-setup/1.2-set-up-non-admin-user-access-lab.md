# 1.2 Set Up Non-Admin User Access \(Lab\)

## Set Up Non-Admin User Access \(Lab\)

An interesting discussion around assigning a non-admin user a "Billing Account User" role and how it was able to "**create**" a project in addition to just **linking it to the Billing Account**.

The bottom line is "if your Google account is _not_ a part of any Organization, then projects will not be owned by any Organization--those projects will be owned by the Google account that created them. And **Google accounts intrinsically have permission to create** _**their own**_ **projects**".
