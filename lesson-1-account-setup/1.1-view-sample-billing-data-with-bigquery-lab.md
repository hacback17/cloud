# 1.1 View Sample Billing Data with BigQuery \(Lab\)



### View Sample Billing Data with BigQuery \(Lab\)

Let's look at the publicly available dataset:

```sql
SELECT *  
FROM `cloud-training-prod-bucket.arch_infra.billing_data`
```

Ordering by **`cost`** or usage amount by adding the below string to your query to sort by the column of your choice. In this query, we are bringing up the entire table contents, but sorting by the highest cost first:

```sql
SELECT *  
FROM `cloud-training-prod-bucket.arch_infra.billing_data`
ORDER BY cost DESC
```

The below query is to find all charges that were more than 3 dollars:

```sql
SELECT product, resource_type, start_time, end_time,  
cost, project_id, project_name, project_labels_key, currency, currency_conversion_rate,
usage_amount, usage_unit
FROM `cloud-training-prod-bucket.arch_infra.billing_data`
WHERE (cost > 3)
```

Find which product had the highest total number of records:

```sql
SELECT product, COUNT(*)
FROM `cloud-training-prod-bucket.arch_infra.billing_data`
GROUP BY product
LIMIT 200
```

Letâ€™s see which product most frequently cost more than a dollar:

```sql
SELECT product, cost, COUNT(*)
FROM `cloud-training-prod-bucket.arch_infra.billing_data`
WHERE (cost > 1)
GROUP BY cost, product
LIMIT 200
```
