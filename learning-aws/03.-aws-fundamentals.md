## AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS Website: [https://www.infrastructure.aws/](https://www.infrastructure.aws/)

* **Region**: AWS has the concept of a **Region**, which is a physical location around the world where they cluster data centers.
* **Edge Locations**: A site that **CloudFront** uses to cache copies of your content for **faster delivery** to users at any location. 

### Global Services: 

* Route53, IAM

### AWS Regions - Provides Resiliency:

* **Geographic Separation - Isolated Fault Domain**
  * If anything terrible should happen such terrorist attack, natural disaster, it wouldn't affect another. This is one of the way AWS achieves fault tolerance and stability.
* **Geopolitical Separation - Different governance**
  * By picking a reason you will be affected by the laws and regulations of the region your infrastructure is stored in.  
  * AWS commits that if you pick one region, it will stay in that region. \(However, there are nuances to that.\)
* **Location Control -** Performance
  * Get as close to your customer as possible for better customer experience 
* AWS Regions provides **resiliency**.
  * If Sydney region gets affected and is down for some reasons, it won't affect the infrastructure available in North. Virginia \(if you have that placed there\). 

### AWS Availability Zones \(AZs\)

* Inside every Region, AWS provides multiple Availability Zones.
  * It could be 2,3,4,5, or even 6 AZs in a Region.
*  **AZs are isolated compute, storage, network, power and facilities within a region. An AZ could be a data center but it could also be multiple data centers. It is a logical construct inside AWS. AWS doesn't give you the visibility what an AZ is.**
* As a solution architect, you should design solutions that are distributed among AZs and resilient.

### Service Resilience

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2850%29.png)

* **Globally Resilient:** 
  * When it takes the whole world to fail, it is a globally resilient service.
  * Example: IAM, Route53
* **Region Resilient:**
  * If you create one RDS DB in Sydney and one in Mumbai, both are different.
  * When you distribute your infrastructure among Regions, so if one fails, it won't impact others.
* **AZ Resilient:**
  * Services can be placed among multiple AZs to make them resilient.
  * If a service is provisioned in one AZ fails, the service will fail.
  * **Virtual Private Cloud** \(VPC\) is a way to create a **private network** and this can work across multiple AZs to **provide resilience**. 

## **Virtual Private Cloud** \(VPC\)

* A **VPC** = A Virtual Network inside AWS
* A VPC is within **1 account** & **1 region**
* Regionally resilient  
* **Private** and **Isolated** unless you decide otherwise
* Two types - **Default VPC** and **Custom VPCs**
  * **You can have only one Default VPC per region.**
  * **But you can have many custom VPCs per region.**
* VPC is used to connect AWS private network to your on-premises network when creating a hybrid environment
* This service is also used to connect to other cloud platforms when you are creating a multi-cloud deployment.

### Default VPC

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2852%29.png)

* A default VPC is created once per region when an AWS account is first created.
* There can only be one default VPC per region, and they can be deleted and recreated from the console UI.
* They always have the same IP range and same '1 subnet per AZ' architecture.
* The way VPCs provide resilient is they are sub-divided into subnets. Each subnet inside of VPC is located in one AZ in that region. This is set on creation and can never be changed.

### Default VPC Facts

* **One per region** - can be removed & recreated
* **Default VPC CIDR** is always **172.31.0.0/16**
* /20 Subnet created in **each AZ** in the region
* Internet Gateway \(IGW\), Security Group \(SG\) & NACL
* Subnets assign public IPv4 addresses
