* **Region**: AWS has the concept of a **Region**, which is a physical location around the world where they cluster data centers.
* **Edge Locations**: A site that **CloudFront** uses to cache copies of your content for **faster delivery** to users at any location. 

### Global Services: Route53, IAM

### AWS Regions:

* **Geographic Separation - Isolated Fault Domain**
  * If anything terrible should happen such terrorist attack, natural disaster, it wouldn't affect another. This is one of the way AWS achieves fault tolerance and stability.
* **Geopolitical Separation - Different governance**
  * By picking a reason you will be affected by the laws and regulations of the region your infrastructure is stored in.  
  * AWS commits that if you pick one region, it will stay in that region. \(However, there are nuances to that.\)
* **Location Control -** Performance
  * Get as close to your customer as possible for better customer experience
