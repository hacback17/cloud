# 01. Fundamentals and AWS Accounts

## AWS Accounts

* An **AWS Account** is a container for **Identities \(users\)** and **Resources**.
* An **Account ROOT USER** has full control over all of **the AWS Account** and any **resources** created within it & **can't be restricted**. 
* Use separate accounts for separate things \(DEV, TEST, PROD\) or teams or products or clients.

## Set up MFA



## Set up Billing

Step 2: Create a **CloudWatch** Alarm.

**CloudWatch Alarm** - Alarms allow you to monitor certain metrics and change states based on certain criteria.

## IAM Basics

Why IAM is required?

* **Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)** is a core AWS Service and is a **globally resilient service**. So any data is **always secure** across AWS regions.
* IAM is what allows additional **identities** \(**users**\) to be created within an AWS account - identities which can be given restricted levels of access.
* IAM identities start with **no permissions** on an AWS Account, but can be granted permissions \(almost\) up to those held by the Account Root User.
* **IAM has almost \(except billing control and account closure\) all privileges as root user. Operationally, IAM of your account is trusted fully by your account, so IAM as a service can do as much as an account root user.**

* So, since an AWS Account fully trust the IAM, if IAM allows one of the identities that it manages to do something, the account automatically trusts the identity in the same way as it trusts IAM. 

### What IAM lets you create?

* Users and Groups are fairly easy to understand. You use User when you need to give access to humans or applications \(for long time\). Groups are the collections of humans and applications.
  * You pick User when you can identify individual thing.
* Roles are usually used by \(AWS\) Services. For example, giving S3 bucket access to an EC2 instance.
  * Used when number of things is uncertain.

### IAM Policy

IAM lets you create these policies, which are essentially objects or documents which can be used to allow or deny access to AWS services when and only when they're attached to **IAM Users, Groups** or **Roles**. **They simply define allow or deny rights to certain services.**
