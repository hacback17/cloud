# 01. Fundamentals and AWS Accounts

## AWS Accounts

* An **AWS Account** is a container for **Identities \(users\)** and **Resources**.
* An **Account ROOT USER** has full control over all of **the AWS Account** and any **resources** created within it & **can't be restricted**. 
* Use separate accounts for separate things \(DEV, TEST, PROD\) or teams or products or clients.
