# Cloud Computing Fundamentals

## NIST Definition of Cloud Computing

#### NIST defines 5 essentials characteristics which a system needs to meet in order to be cloud. NIST Special Publication 80-145 : [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf)

### \#1 - On-Demands Self-Service

* "...can provision capabilities as needed **without requiring human interaction**"

### \#2 - Broad Network Access

* "Capabilities are available over the **network** accessed through **standard mechanisms...**"
* In short, access from anywhere using standard mechanisms like VPNs, HTTP, HTTPs, etc.

### \#3 - Resource Pooling 

* Providers share resources to consumers. Resources are available at multiple locations, you just need to decide where to get the resource from.

### \#4 - Rapid elasticity

* Get more resources quickly as needed

### \#5 - Measured Service

* Pay only for what you use. Nothing in advance.

## Public vs Private vs Hybrid vs Multi-Cloud

* **Public Cloud** = using **1** public cloud
* **Private Cloud** = using on-premises **\*real\*** cloud \(if they meet 5 essential characteristics\)
* **Multi-Cloud** = using more than 1 public cloud
* **Hybrid Cloud** = **Public** and **Private** Clouds
* Hybrid Cloud is **NOT** public cloud + legacy on-premises.
* **Hybrid Network/Environment** = **Public cloud** + **legacy on-premises**
