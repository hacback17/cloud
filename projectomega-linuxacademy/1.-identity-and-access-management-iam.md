# 1. Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)

## What is IAM?

IAM is a globally resilient web service that helps you _**securely control access to AWS resources**_.

* **IAM** is where you manage your AWS **users** and their access to AWS accounts and services.
* **IAM** is commonly used to manage:
  * Users
  * Groups
  * IAM Access Policies
  * Roles
* Note: The user created when you created the AWS account is called the "root" user.
* By default, the root user has _**full**_ administrative rights and access to every part of the account.
* By default, any new users you create in the AWS accounts are created with **no access to any AWS services**.
* For all users \(besides the root user\), permissions must be given that grant access to AWS services.
