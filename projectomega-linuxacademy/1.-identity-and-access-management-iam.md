# 1. Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)

## What is IAM?

IAM is a globally resilient web service that helps you _**securely control access to AWS resources**_.

* **IAM** is where you manage your AWS **users** and their access to AWS accounts and services.
* **IAM** is commonly used to manage:
  * Users
  * Groups
  * IAM Access Policies
  * Roles
* Note: The user created when you created the AWS account is called the "root" user.
* By default, the root user has _**full**_ administrative rights and access to every part of the account.
* By default, any new users you create in the AWS accounts are created with **no access to any AWS services**.
* For all users \(besides the root user\), permissions must be given that grant access to AWS services.

## IAM Groups

An **IAM group** is a **collection of IAM users**. Groups allow you to **set and manage permissions for multiple users** at the same time.

* Groups are a more convenient and efficient way to manage account permissions. 
* **A user can have access to up to 10 groups.** One user can be part of several groups. 

## IAM Roles

A role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf is called a [service role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-role). For example, you can an EC2 instance to store all the log files in an S3 bucket.
